# Boost.Thread with Boost.Asio
The Boost libraries also have the Boost.Thread library that is used to execute tasks concurrently,
but the Boost.Thread library is used to access internal resources,
such as the CPU core resource, while the Boost.Asio library is used to access external resources,
such as network connections, because the data is sent and received by a network card.

# Boost I/O service
The core object of the Boost::Asio namespace is io_service.
The I/O service is a channel that is used to access operating system resources
and establish communication between our program and the operating system that performs I/O requests.
There is also an I/O object that has the role of submitting I/O requests.
For instance, the tcp::socket object will provide a socket programming request from our program to the operating system.


# Using and blocking the run() function
One of the most frequently used functions in the I/O service object is the run() function.
It is used to run the io_service object's event processing loop.
It will block the next statement program until all the work in the io_service object is completed
and there are no more handlers to be dispatched.
If we stop the io_service object, it will no longer block the program.

# Event
In programming, event is an action or occurrence detected by a program,
which will be handled by the program using the event handler object.
The io_service object has one or more instances where events are handled, which is event processing loop.
