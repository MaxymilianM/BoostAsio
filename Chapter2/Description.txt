# Network architecture

To learn:
- Distinguishing between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model
- Exploring IP addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6
- Troubleshooting TCP/IP problems using various tools


Network architecture is structured with layers and protocols.
Each layer in the architecture has its own role,
while its main purpose is to offer a certain service to the higher layer
and communicate with the adjoining layers.
However, a protocol is a collection of rules
and conventions that are used by all the communicating parties to standardize the communication process.
For instance, when the layer n in a device communicates with another layer n in another device,
for the communication to take place, they have to use the same protocol.


There are two popular network architectures that are used nowadays:
 - the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
 - TCP/IP reference models.


# The OSI reference model
The OSI model is used to connect to the open systemsâ€”these are the systems that are open and communicate with other systems.
By using this model, we do not depend on an operating system anymore, so we are allowed to communicate with any operating system on any computer.
This model contains seven layers, where each layer has a specific function and defines the way data is handled on certain different layers.
The seven layers that are contained in this model are the:
 - Physical layer,
 - Data Link layer,
 - Network layer,
 - Transport layer,
 - Session layer,
 - Presentation layer,
 - Application layer.


# The Physical layer
This is the first layer in the OSI model and contains a definition of the network's physical specification,
including the physical media (cables and connectors) and basic devices (repeaters and hubs).
The layer is responsible for the input raw bits transmission data stream into zeros
and for the ones that are on the communication channel. It then places the data onto the physical media.
It is concerned with data transmission integrity and makes sure that the bits that are sent from one device
are exactly the same as the data that is received by the other device.

# The Data Link layer
The main role of the Data Link layer is to provide a link for raw data transmission.
Before the data is transmitted, it is broken up into data frames, and the Data Link layer transmits them consecutively.
The receiver will send back an acknowledge frame for each frame that has been sent if the service is reliable.
This layer consists of two sublayers:
 - Logical Link Control (LLC)
 - Media Access Control (MAC).

# The LLC sublayer is responsible for transmission error checking and deals with frame transmission.
# The MAC sublayer defines how to retrieve data from the physical media or store data in the physical media.

We can also find the MAC address, also called as the physical address, in this layer.
The MAC address is used to identify every device that connects to the network because it is unique for each device.
Using Command Prompt, we can obtain the address by typing the following command in the console window:
> ipconfig /all

We will get the console output, as follows, after ignoring all other information except Windows IP Configuration and Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi.
We can find the MAC address in the Physical Address section, which is 80-19-34-CB-BF-FB for my own environment.
