## Network architecture

To learn:
- Distinguishing between the OSI model and the TCP/IP model
- Exploring IP addresses in both IPv4 and IPv6
- Troubleshooting TCP/IP problems using various tools


Network architecture is structured with layers and protocols.
Each layer in the architecture has its own role,
while its main purpose is to offer a certain service to the higher layer
and communicate with the adjoining layers.
However, a protocol is a collection of rules
and conventions that are used by all the communicating parties to standardize the communication process.
For instance, when the layer n in a device communicates with another layer n in another device,
for the communication to take place, they have to use the same protocol.


There are two popular network architectures that are used nowadays:
 - the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
 - TCP/IP reference models.


## The OSI reference model
The OSI model is used to connect to the open systemsâ€”these are the systems that are open and communicate with other systems.
By using this model, we do not depend on an operating system anymore, so we are allowed to communicate with any operating system on any computer.
This model contains seven layers, where each layer has a specific function and defines the way data is handled on certain different layers.
The seven layers that are contained in this model are the:
 - Physical layer,
 - Data Link layer,
 - Network layer,
 - Transport layer,
 - Session layer,
 - Presentation layer,
 - Application layer.


# The Physical layer (bits)
This is the first layer in the OSI model and contains a definition of the network's physical specification,
including the physical media (cables and connectors) and basic devices (repeaters and hubs).
The layer is responsible for the input raw bits transmission data stream into zeros
and for the ones that are on the communication channel. It then places the data onto the physical media.
It is concerned with data transmission integrity and makes sure that the bits that are sent from one device
are exactly the same as the data that is received by the other device.


# The Data Link layer (Frame (LLC and MAC))
The main role of the Data Link layer is to provide a link for raw data transmission.
Before the data is transmitted, it is broken up into data frames, and the Data Link layer transmits them consecutively.
The receiver will send back an acknowledge frame for each frame that has been sent if the service is reliable.
This layer consists of two sublayers:
 - Logical Link Control (LLC)
 - Media Access Control (MAC).

# The LLC sublayer is responsible for transmission error checking and deals with frame transmission.
# The MAC sublayer defines how to retrieve data from the physical media or store data in the physical media.

We can also find the MAC address, also called as the physical address, in this layer.
The MAC address is used to identify every device that connects to the network because it is unique for each device.
Using Command Prompt, we can obtain the address by typing the following command in the console window:
> ipconfig /all

We will get the console output, as follows, after ignoring all other information except Windows IP Configuration and Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi.
We can find the MAC address in the Physical Address section, which is 80-19-34-CB-BF-FB for my own environment.

# The Network layer (Packet (routine and IP addres))
The Network layer is responsible for defining the best way to route the packets from a source to the destination device.
It will generate routing tables using Internet Protocol (IP) as the routing protocol,
and the IP address is used to make sure that the data gets its route to the required destination.
There are two versions of IP nowadays:
- IPv4,
- IPv6.
In IPv4, we use 32-bit addresses to address the protocol and we use 128-bit addresses in IPv6.


# The Transport layer (Segment (TCP or UDP))
The Transport layer is responsible for transferring data from a source to destination.
It will split up the data into smaller parts, or in this case segments,
and then will join all the segments to restore the data to its initial form in the destination.

There are two main protocols that work in this layer:
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

TCP supplies the delivery of data by establishing a session.
The data will not be transmitted until a session is established.
TCP is also known as the connection-oriented protocol, which means that the session has to be established before transmitting the data.
UDP is a method of delivering data with the best efforts, but does not give a guaranteed delivery because it does not establish a session.
Therefore, UDP is also known as the connection-less protocol.


# The Session layer (Session ID)
The Session layer is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and termination of the session.
We can analogize the session like a connection between two devices on the network.
For example, if we want to send a file from a computer to another, this layer will establish the connection first before the file can be sent.
This layer will then make sure that the connection is still up until the file is sent completely.
Finally, this layer will terminate the connection if it is no longer needed.
The connection we talk about is the session.

This layer also makes sure that the data from a different application is not interchanged.
For example, if we run the Internet browser, chat application, and download manager at the same time,
this layer will be responsible for establishing the session for every single application
and ensure that they remain separated from other applications.

There are three communication methods that are used by this layer:
- simplex,
- half-duplex,
- full-duplex.

In the simplex method, data can only be transferred by one party, so the other cannot transfer any data.
This method is no longer common in use, since we need applications that can interact with each other.
In the half-duplex method, any data can be transferred to all the involved devices,
but only one device can transfer the data in the time, after it completes the sending process.
Then, the others can also send and transfer data.
The full-duplex method can transfer data to all the devices at the same time.
To send and receive data, this method uses different paths.


# The Presentation layer (Encryption and Compression)
The Presentation layer role is used to determine the data that has been sent,
to translate the data into the appropriate format, and then to present it.
For example, we send an MP3 file over the network and the file is split up into several segments.
Then, using the header information on the segment, this layer will construct the file by translating the segments.

Moreover, this layer is responsible for data compression and decompression
because all the data transmitted over the Internet is compressed to save the bandwidth.
This layer is also responsible for data encryption and decryption in order to secure communication between two devices.


# The Application layer (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS)
The Application layer deals with the computer application that is used by a user.
Only the application that connects to a network will connect to this layer.
This layer contains several protocols that are needed by a user, which are as follows:

The Domain Name System (DNS): This protocol is the one that finds the hostname of an IP address.
With this system, we do not need to memorize every IP address any longer, just the hostname.
We can easily remember a word in the hostname instead of a bunch of numbers in the IP address.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): This protocol is the one that transmits data over the Internet on web pages
We also have the HTTPS format that is used to send encrypted data for security issues.

The File Transfer Protocol (FTP): This protocol is the one that is used to transfer files from or to an FTP server.

The Trivial FTP (TFTP): This protocol is similar to FTP, which is used to send smaller files.

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): This protocol is a method that is used to assign the TCP/IP configuration dynamically.

The Post Office Protocol (POP3): This protocol is an electronic mail protocol used to get back e-mails from POP3 servers.
The server is usually hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): This protocol is in contrast with POP3 and is used to send electronic mails.

The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): This protocol is used to receive e-mail messages.
With this protocol, users can save their e-mail messages on their folder on a local computer.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP): This protocol is used to manage network devices (routers and switches)
and detect problems to report them before they become significant.

The Server Message Block (SMB): This protocol is an FTP that is used on Microsoft networks primarily for file and printer sharing.

Application layer also decides whether enough network resources are available for network access.
For instance, if you want to surf the Internet using an Internet browser,
the Application layer decides whether access to the Internet is available using HTTP.



## The TCP/IP reference model

The TCP/IP model was created before the OSI model.
This model works in a similar way to the OSI model, except that it just contains four layers.
Each layer on the TCP/IP model corresponds to the layers of the OSI model.
The TCP/IP Application layer maps the (Application, Presentation, Session) layers of the OSI model.
The TCP/IP Transport layer maps the Transport layer of the OSI model.
The TCP/IP Internet layer maps the Network layer of the OSI model.
The TCP/IP Link layer maps the (Data link and Physical) layers of the OSI model.

These are the main roles of each layer in the TCP/IP model:
- The Link layer is responsible for determining the protocols and physical devices that are used in the data transmission process.
- The Internet layer is responsible for determining the best routing for the data transmission process by addressing the packet.
- The Transport layer is responsible for establishing the communication between the two devices and sending the packet.
- The Application layer is responsible for providing services to applications that run on a computer.
  Because of the absence of the session and presentation layers, applications have to be included in any required session and presentation functions.
